# Leather Cutting tips
Leather cutting should probably be well ventaliated. Leather can stink when you ~~burn~~ cut it with a laser. I suspect that there is a toxicity and allergy issue with some types of leather, namely "chrome tanned" leather. This risk doesn't seem to be very accute. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_toxicity> Given the choice between Chrome and Veg tanned leather, I will pick the Veg for laser cutting. 

In some ways leather can behave like acrylic. If you a create sharp inside corner, that can focus stresses and the leather can rip, just like acrylic can crack.

In traditional leathercraft there are a couple of conventional wisdoms when it comes to making holes.
* Punched holes are stronger than slits
* Longer slits are best terminated with punched holes to releave stresses.
* There is an interesting and detailed exploration of the above in the first comment at <https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MikeCreuzer/posts/gyksFZr36fU>

I suspect we can take advantage of some aspects of laser cutting. 

When cutting small slits for stitching or whatever, use a single power setting for the laser so as the laser has a longer dwell time at the start and stop of the cut it will slightly dog-bone the slit.
