I recently purchased an Ozark Trail LED Headlamp to replace one I left at my folk's place. I was hoping for a AA headlamp, but walmart doesn't sell those anymore, so I got the cheapest AAA one they had as it sported the longest battery life.

It doesn't have the features of the other lamps, like a red LED lamp.

So here is my attempt to fix this. Print the cover in something like Red Taulman T-Glase to create a red filter for this light. Attach it with a rubber band or someother method as deemed appropraite.

This particular model is walmart SKU 1742701068
