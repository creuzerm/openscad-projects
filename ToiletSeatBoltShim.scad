/*
Toilet seat wobble fixer
This bushing shims the bolt to the toilet so the seat won't wiggle so bad

Mike Creuzer - Mike@Creuzer.com - 2012-08-23
Update 2012-12-23 Added offset to allow for elliptical usage for seats that don't exactly align to the center of the stool's holes.
Update 2013-01-14 Tweaked parameter names for customizer

Measurements are dimensionless but assumed to be in mm for most programs.
