1) Create film holder for your cell phone.

2) Print the film holder phone case

3) Procure a DVD/CD-ROM laser lens and install it into the film holder.

4) Place phone into film holder and load into camera.

5) The cell phone CCD probably isn't going to be in the exact location as the film, so the camera may need to be re-focused a little bit. (I know, I was hoping that I wouldn't need to re-focus, maybe the next try).

6) Take macro photos from far, far away!
