Here lie the parts for an idea...

A robot made using RepRap technology. RepRap mechanics and motion control for the legs.

A rather large hexapod walking using Misumi 1515 aluminim extrusions for the 'bones', and fiberglass 'whip' driveway markers for the tendons to give the whole mechanism a little 'spring' so the lightweight frame doesn't bend.

Each leg has it's own RepRap control board and is moved by being issued standard gcode coordinates as to where the ends of the legs are expected.

Most of the weight is to be as close to the 'foot' as possible. Each leg has it's own battery pack in the foot. This means the legs only need to be strong enough to lift themselves.
